This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a React Native project.  It typically manifests as a cryptic error message, making it difficult to pinpoint the underlying cause. The error may be related to various factors, including incorrect project configuration, dependency issues, or conflicts with other tools or processes.  A common scenario is when building for a specific platform (like Android or iOS) where the build process gets interrupted without a clear explanation. Sometimes, the error is related to missing or corrupted dependencies.  Example:  `Error: Command failed: ...` with a long, unhelpful stack trace.
