# Expo CLI Cryptic Build Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult to diagnose, error encountered when using the Expo CLI to build React Native applications.  The error often presents as a generic failure message, offering little insight into the root cause. This example showcases a potential scenario and a solution to help developers debug similar issues.  The `crypticExpoError.js` file contains example code demonstrating a situation that might lead to the error, while `crypticExpoErrorSolution.js` provides a corrected version and debugging strategies. 

## How to Reproduce (Example)

1.  Ensure you have the Expo CLI installed (`npm install -g expo-cli`).
2.  Create a new Expo project: `expo init my-project`
3.  (Example scenario leading to the error):  Introduce an incorrect dependency or configuration in `package.json` or `app.json` (e.g., a misspelled dependency or missing a required setting). 
4.  Attempt to build the application using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`.

The goal is to highlight the difficulties of diagnosing such errors, and to provide methods for systematic troubleshooting.
